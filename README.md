dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles for Vim and bash_profile.

If you want to use my vim configuration, please follow the instructions:

1. `git https://github.com/flyaway1217/dotfiles.git ~/`
2. `cd ~/dotfiles`
3. `sh setup.sh`
4. Ready to go

**Caution**: This `setup.sh` will overwrite your old vim configutation. Please do the backup for your old settings if you want to perserve the old ones.
